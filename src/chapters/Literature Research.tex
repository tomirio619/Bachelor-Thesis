first start with a literature research into the validity and reliability of activity trackers in \Cref{section: Reliable Data Collection}.
Afterwards, we will take a look at relevant biomarkers that could be useful in the prediction of good and bad days for MS patients (\Cref{section:relevant biomarkers}).
This is also done by conducting a literature research.
Based on these findings, we finally choose three biomarkers in \Cref{section:Selecting Relevant Biomarkers} and further investigate how they could be used for analysis.
